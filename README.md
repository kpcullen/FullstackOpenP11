# Phonebook App Deployment Pipeline

**Description:**
This repository demonstrates a GitHub Actions workflow for automating the build, test, and deployment of a Phonebook app located in the `phonebook-frontend` directory. The pipeline leverages Render.com for deployment.

**Workflow:**

The `workflows` directory contains a YAML file defining the automated workflow. This workflow will trigger on specific events, such as pushes to the main branch or pull request merges.

**Steps:**

1. **Build:** The workflow will build the React app located in the `phonebook-frontend` directory.
2. **Test:** (Optional) You can include test scripts to run automated tests on the built app.
3. **Deploy:** The workflow will deploy the built app to Render.com, using the configured service details.
